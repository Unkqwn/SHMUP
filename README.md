Hey there to anyone checking out this project.

This repository was made 3 years after the project was over. I made it so I could make changes to the project and keep them online for anyone to see.
Xander and Roman made good code for the game but this was a full rework on the code so most of their code has disappeared unfortunately.
Most art made by Sergej, Lucas or Keja has been untouched by me, the only changes were fixing rotations.
