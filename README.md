Hey there to anyone checking out this project.

This repository was made 3 years after the project was over. I made it so I could make changes to the project and keep them online for anyone to see.
This was our first group project and the first year of coding in general and that's the main reason for the rework.
Xander Kortekaas and Roman Agterberg made good code for the game but this was a full rework on the code so most of their code has been deleted unfortunately to prevent confusion.
I'd recommend you check them out as well as they have definitly improved too.
Most art made by Sergej, Lucas or Keja has been untouched by me, the only changes were fixing rotations.
